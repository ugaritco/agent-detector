## Adding a New Agent

To add detection for a new agent:

1. Add a new case to the `KnownAgent` enum in `src/KnownAgent.php`.
2. Add the detection logic (env var check or file check) in `AgentDetector::detect()` in `src/AgentDetector.php` — order matters, earlier checks take priority.
3. Add tests in `tests/AgentDetectorTest.php`.
